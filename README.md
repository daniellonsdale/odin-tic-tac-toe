# odin-tic-tac-toe
The Odin Project's Tic Tac Toe project - https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-tic-tac-toe

Review:
- Overall, I think this project went pretty smoothly and I was able to use what I've learned so far without too many problems
- I was able to fix the logic of the game quickly when I realized the error of comparing hardcoded win condition arrays to the current game board
- The UI is very simple but works for the purposes of the project and scales decently well to various viewports
